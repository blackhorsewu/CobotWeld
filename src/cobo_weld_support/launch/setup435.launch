  This file launches the UR5 with a Fronius Straight Torch as the end effector
  and an Intel Realsense D435i camera to capture point clouds.
  It can use MoveIt to plan and execute planning.
  
  When the argument with the name "sim" is set to true, it will use the
  ROS-Industrial simulator to drive the robot image in RViz to move but
  NOT the real robot.

  Whn the argument with the name "sim" is set to false, and the argument
  named "robot_ip" is set to the ip address of the robot, it will use the
  real robot to execute the planned action.
