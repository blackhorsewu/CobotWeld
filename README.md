# Cobo Weld

This is a project of the CNERC
## Chinese National Engineering Research Centre for Steel Structure (Hong Kong Branch)


It is based on previous work by Jeffery Zhou and Maggie.
That was almost completely in Python.

It is going to be partly ROS C++ and mostly in python.
It will also be heavily depend on Open3D.

It is going to use the URx (Python) for actually driving
the robotic arm UR5 (maybe UR10 later) instead of using
MoveIt of ROS.

It is being constructed on this 19 July, 2022. (Tuesday).

After I have upgraded from melodic to noetic, it seems 
I need to do some more for the Intel Realsense. The 
details are [here](https://answers.ros.org/question/363889/intel-realsens-on-ubuntu-2004-ros-noetic-installation-desription/).   

I will have to do this anyway if I want to use Realsense, 
especially if I want to do hand eye calibration. 

Just done the install, reboot and test. ROS and Unistall still 
need to be done.
